This is a repository focused on the optimization of a Parallel_plate Avalanche Counter with Optical Readout by using differentiable programming and machine learning techniques.

-- CAUTION! It is a work in progress!

It contains several tools for the reconstruction of the position of the impining particle, implemented techniques to develop a Neural Network trained to predict the reconstructed position from the detector configuration and the beam position and the tools to optimize the detector performance (reconstruction error) leveraging automatic differentiation.
